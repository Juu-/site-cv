# Site-CV

## Why can it be useful ?

If you are looking for a CV website and don't have any time to develop it, you can fork this GIT repo and edit what you want in the json file.

## How does it work ?

You just need to edit the JSON file in the **lang** folder and some lines in the **index.html** file like the title or the name.

The internalization is available with the *changeLang(String lang)* javascript function.
But actualy deactivate due to the only lang file for me (french one)


Enjoy,
